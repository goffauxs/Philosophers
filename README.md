# Philosophers
42 Philosophers project

## About
This project is a version of the [Dining Philosophers Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).

The goal of this project was to learn to avoid deadlock and race conditions when creating multithreaded applications.

### Rules
The program takes the following arguments:

`./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`

- `number_of_philosophers`: The number of philosophers and also the number
of forks.
- `time_to_die` (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
- `time_to_eat` (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
- `time_to_sleep` (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
- `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

### Output
The output of the program is in the format `<timestamp> <philosopher (1 to number_of_philosophers)> <action>`

Each philosopher
